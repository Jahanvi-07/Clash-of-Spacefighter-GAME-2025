*ðŸš€ Clash of spacefighters*

## Overview

Clash of Spacefighter is a 2D space shooter game developed in Java where players pilot a spaceship to defeat incoming enemy fleets. The game features keyboard controls, shooting mechanics, enemy AI, collision detection, score tracking, and increasing difficulty levels. Built using Java Swing/AWT (or JavaFX if applicable), it showcases core concepts of object-oriented programming, event-driven logic, and basic game loop design. The project emphasizes smooth gameplay, efficient rendering, and modular code structure for maintainability.
